Add 'Host' App to top-level project directory on your local machine. This will be included in .gitignore, so we each need to add the repo and make a few changes to it separately in order to test our app.


1. From your local machine at root level of project, perform following:

"git clone https://github.com/clintonwoo/hackernews-react-graphql.git"


2. Once cloned locally, navigate to hackernews-react-graphql/server/server.ts


3. Add following changes to this file:

- Add import of following function on line 13:
/**
import invokeGraphERRQL from './../../package/src/index';
**/

- At line 191, add following middleware as follows:
/**
    //for requests to /grapherrql, go get grapherrql html and return on req
    expressServer.get('/grapherrql', invokeGraphERRQL({
      endpoint: '/graphql/'
    })),
**/
